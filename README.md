# Python-tkinter-project

This was the first ever project of mine which was done in my 1st year of graduation.
We tried to make an offline shopping cart using python's <b>tkinter</b> UI module. No databases were used as we didn't have any about databases when we were working on this project. The data was stored in .txt files and data retreival/dumping was done using python itself.
